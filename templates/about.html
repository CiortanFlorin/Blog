        <p>I am a python developer currently working for IBM where I am coding, designing, deploying, and debugging development projects and I made this site specifically to showcase some of my personal projects, outside of work.</p>
        <p>My passions are fitness, running, coffee and, of course, writing perfectly working code. I have begun coding as part of my courses for my engineering bachelorâ€™s degree which I have finished in 2020 and I am currently studying for my master degree in Administration of Databases.</p>
        <p>The technologies which I am comfortable with are Python, MySQL, MongoDB,  HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and Linux. For Python I can mention some libraries such as: Flask, Requests, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Tkinter and Turtle.</p>
